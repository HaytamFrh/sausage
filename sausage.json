        "step1":"Sausage Man is the latest mobile battle royale game released by publisher XD. In this game, players will again be invited to feel the thrill of battle royale battles for up to 100 players at once. In addition, the battle area is also made very wide, and there are a lot of cool customizations. In addition to relying on intense shooting action with shooting animations to realistic weapon models, the battle royale gameplay offered by Sausage Man allows you to perform crazy and creative actions in dominating the course of battle.",
	"step2":"The first thing you need to pay attention to is the landing location. Each map in Sausage Man has its advantages and disadvantages, there are places with good loot that are targeted by many players, there are also quiet places which are usually located in the outermost area of ​​the map. For beginners who are still confused about choosing a landing location, get off at a relatively safe location. Currently there are two battle royale maps in Sausage Man, namely Battle Island and Rainbow Island. But the two maps actually have the same strategy. The point is to stay away from the dive path and aim for locations that are far from the center of the map. Don't be confused and jump down in the place chosen by other players.",
	"step3":"Another landing tip that you can try is not to go down to the end point. When the bus has reached the end of the track, players who are still inside will be forced to jump at the very end location. Usually, these players who haven't dropped off are afk or even disconnected players so you can kill them easily. This trick you must try if you are on a whim or confused about where to get off. Looting is the first thing you should do after getting off the bus. Almost like other battle royale games, you go down without being equipped with anything and you have to find your own war equipment. This equipment can be in the form of weapons, armor, bags, scopes, helmets, or healing items scattered on the game map.",
	"step4":"Complete Verification",
	"step5":"The first loot you have to look for is a weapon so you don't fight empty-handed. Due to limited inventory capacity and looting time, make sure you prioritize looting only the items you need. For safer looting, you can try looting in a closed place like inside a home. Make sure you loot an SMG or Assault Rifle type weapon first, because this type of weapon for killing the enemies than other types of weapons.",
	"step6":"As explained above, of course you need a weapon. Sausage Man has a wide variety of weapons, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. There are many types of weapons that are powerful in close, medium, and long range. Pick a strategy, because when you choose the weapon to be used, of course you have to understand its use. For example, when you just get off the bus, try to get two types such as SMG and Assault Rifle. After that, you can replace it with other types of weapons, such as Sniper for a strategy to neutralize enemies from a distance, or Shotgun for close range.",
	"step7":"In Sausage Man, each weapon has its own recoil. You may not even be able to withstand the recoil of the weapon and it will be disastrous for you. To overcome this, all you have to do is keep practicing while looking for the weapon that suits you best. ",
